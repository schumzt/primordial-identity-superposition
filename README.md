## 📌 Overview  

**Primordial Identity Superposition** is a computational-philosophical framework exploring  
how **identity**, **memory**, and **moral behavior** interact within intelligent agents  
(biological or artificial).  
It introduces a novel structure that blends:

- Identity superposition (다중적 자아의 중첩)
- Memory attenuation (기억 감쇠 구조)
- Moral attenuation (도덕적 감쇠)
- Alignment-oriented behavioral prediction  
- Symbolic + computational modeling

This repository serves as both a **research archive** and a **computational sandbox**  
for developing formal models surrounding identity coherence, memory noise,  
and moral grounding under high-dimensional cognition.

## 🧭 Project Vision  

This project aims to bridge:

- AI alignment  
- Philosophy of identity  
- Cognitive science  
- Computational ethics  
- Memory architecture  

It explores how intelligent systems might  
preserve coherence, moral grounding,  
and stable identity under high-dimensional cognitive noise.

This repository will continue to evolve as the research develops.
